//ِEvent Loop

/*
The event loop is what allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations —
 despite the fact that JavaScript is single-threaded —
 by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible.

Since most modern kernels are multithreaded,
they can handle multiple operations executing in the background.
When one of these operations completes,
the kernel tells Node.js so that the appropriate callback may be added to the poll queue
to eventually be executed.
